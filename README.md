# MockRobot Device Driver

MockRobot is a robotic arm which moves samples to various locations within a system. This program simulates a user's ability to control the MockRobot device by calling functions of a Device Driver. The Device Driver processes commands sent by a pre-existing UI and forwards the commands to the MockRobot's API which controls the robotic arm.
